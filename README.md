Predicting Earthquake Magnitudes & Depths

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:

- Predict earthquake magnitudes
- Predict earthquake deoth ranges
- Showcase basic proficiency with Feedforward Neural Networks in TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Visualize insights with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- 
TOOLS:
Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Framework: TensorFlow & PyTorch
Machine Learning Models: Feedforward Neural Network
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn & Tableau
Other: Pandas, NumPy, Sci-Kit Learn

DATASET INFO:

- The dataset contains global earthquake data starting in 1976 and ending in 2024.
- Each recorded earthquake contains information such as latitude, longitude, magnitude, depth, depth error and rms and dmin to name a few.

Important NOTE: To start exploring the project, begin with the script titled "EarthquakeTensor.ipynb." The first script involves the use of TensorFlow to 
to create a neural network predicting earthquake magnitudes. The following script titled "EarthquakePyTorch.ipynb" involves a neural network in PyTorch
to predict earthquake depth ranges.

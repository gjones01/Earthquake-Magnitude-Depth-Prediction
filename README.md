Predicting Earthquake Magnitudes & Depths

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:

- Predict earthquake magnitudes
- Predict earthquake deoth ranges
- Showcase basic proficiency with Feedforward Neural Networks in TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Visualize insights with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  
TOOLS:
- Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Framework: TensorFlow & PyTorch
- Machine Learning Model: Feedforward Neural Network
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn & Tableau
- Other: Pandas, NumPy, Sci-Kit Learn

DATASET INFO:

- The dataset contains global earthquake data starting in 1976 and ending in 2024.
- Each recorded earthquake contains information such as latitude, longitude, magnitude, depth, depth error, rms and dmin to name a few.

Important NOTE: 

- To start exploring the project, begin with the script titled "EarthquakeTensor.ipynb." The first script involves the use of TensorFlow to 
to create a neural network predicting earthquake magnitudes. The following script titled "EarthquakePyTorch.ipynb" involves a neural network in PyTorch
to predict earthquake depth ranges. 

- In the folder titled "data" there are visualizations, two of which are .twb files. These are interactive Tableau files that allow you to interact and see information about each data point. 

- A folder titled "Outputs" includes photos of the respective model results.
